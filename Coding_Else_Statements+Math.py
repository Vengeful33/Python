#You can also do Math Inside a Blook of code:

High_Score = 10000
User_Score = 9000

To_High_Score = High_Score - User_Score
print ("Your where this close to the high Score")
print (To_High_Score)

CurrentScore = 20  *  50
print (CurrentScore)

BadScore = 20/50
print (BadScore)

#You can do the same with + for additon, you can have as many spaces as you want inbetween the variables or numbers, make sure it is on the same line.
