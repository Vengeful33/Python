#Varible Checking, == should be seen as "is equal too sign", we call < > == >= <= != operators:
Answer = "Four"
if Answer == "Four":
    print("Correct")

# != Should be seen as different or not equal too"
WrongAnswer = "Three"
if WrongAnswer != "Four":
    print("Wrong Answer")

#You can use moth greater or equal signs.
Address = 1001
if Address >= 900:

#This gets skipped because it is a false statement
if Address <= 500:

#You can Define variables, boolens, strings and others if they are true or false:
Day = True
if Day == True:
    print("Today is Monday")

#You can use not to change a boolens value
Night = not True
if Night == True:
    print("It is Night")

#Boolens are the type of vaule that is the condition of an if statement:

#Make sure all Boolens are capitalised so no true or false, it has to be True or False:

#Numbers should be without "" so it should be 50 not "50":

#= are not a comparison since it only defines a value.
